I graduated from [UESC](http://uesc.br) with a Computer Science degree in 2006, worked at a Brazilian Research Facility called CEPEDI and cofounded Techmobil, a mobile and web development company. I've also worked at Bopia.com developing Ruby on Rails applications and at Todobebe Inc as Lead Developer.

I enjoy traveling, swimming, playing acoustic guitar and reading.
